A highly-minimal workflow tool for small teams (2–4 people) using Git. Anchor4Git wraps Git into a simple **Download → Edit → Upload** mental model so users never need to know Git commands.

> [!WARNING]
> Anchor4Git requires `git`. Please install it on your device.

## Features

- **No Git knowledge required** — users never run Git commands directly.
- **Workspace-first** — users edit files normally, anchor4git handles versioning.
- **Auto-save before risky operations** — dirty workspaces are saved automatically.
- **Force push model** — simplified for small, trusted teams.
- **Conflicts handled in editor** — visual merge UX instead of CLI confusion.

```bash
pipx anchor4git
